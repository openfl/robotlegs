INSTALLATION

This distribution of Robotlegs AS3 Micro-Architecture provides a production ready binary SWC file (robotlegs-framework-v2.2.1.swc).

The SWC file should be enough to get started. Simply drop it in your projects libs folder (or wherever you keep external libraries) and you will have access to the fully functioning framework. 


BUILDING

In addition to the SWC file in this distribution package, the Robotlegs AS3 Micro-Architecture vv2.2.1 source code is also provided.

The source code is dependent on the Swiftsuspenders v2.1.0 library which can be found at: https://github.com/tschneidereit/SwiftSuspenders

If you would prefer to build from the source, it is highly recommended that you download the Robotlegs AS3 Micro-Architecture project in its entirety. This project contains all of the required libraries and ANT build scripts to generate SWC files of the framework. This project can be found at: https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework
